# Identification of seed coat sculpture 
##Introduction

Seed coat characteristics provide important information in the taxonomy of Allium. The seed coat surface was more diverse. In this work, we explored new classification for Allium seed coats, using CNN network on Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images over 100 species of Allium seeds. Seed testa sculpture has divided into two walls: 
1. Anticlinal wall: irregular curved, irregular curved to nearly straight, straight, S, U, UO, O.
2. Periclinal wall: granule, small verrucae, large verrucae, marginal verruca, verrucate verrucae.

Dataset is consisted of more than 100 species from (Baasanmunkh et al., 2020) [^1]
